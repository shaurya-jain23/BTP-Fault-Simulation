--- Material Properties Summary ---
Total layers: 10
Sandstone layers: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (Target Young's: 100-125 MPa)
Shale layers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (Target Young's: 100-125 MPa)
Average density: 2500 kg/m³

⚠️  Phase 0 uses reduced stiffness (factor: 0.001)
   Stiffness will be GRADUALLY restored after bonding to avoid force explosion
